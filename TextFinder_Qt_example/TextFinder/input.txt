Qt is developed by an open source project, the Qt Project, involving developers as individuals and from firms working to advance Qt, such as Nokia, Digia, and others. Before the launch of the Qt Project, it was produced by Nokia's Qt Development Frameworks division, which came into being after Nokia's acquisition of the Norwegian company Trolltech, the original producer of Qt.[25] In February 2011 Nokia announced its decision to drop Symbian technologies and base their future smartphones on Microsoft platform instead. One month later Nokia announced the sale of Qt's commercial licensing and professional services to Digia PLC, although Nokia will remain the main development force behind the framework.[26] On May 9, it was announced on the Qt Labs website that the groundwork was being laid for the next major version of Qt, with the expectation that Qt 5 would be released in 2012.[27]
